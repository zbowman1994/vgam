## Comments:
### Wk. 3:
* Shouldn't see any ? under Duration for tasks. If unsure, set to 1 day.
* Some git comments could be improved.
* Some commits being made directly on master.
* Issues, Designated work looks good.

### Wk. 4:
* touch ups is past due, adjust dates (I think you mean June, not May). May want to add new tasks for writing report, preparing presentation.
* Commit msgs are improved, good work.
* Branching and merging good. Careful with branch names! Make sure they reflect what you are doing.
* Keep up with the Issue Tracker. Use it for Ideas, Bugs, discussions, 'ToDo'
